# Shortnote

Shortnote is a shorthand English notation language for quickly writing text. Shortnote is compilable into common English.

## Purpose

Shortnote is built for everybody, including creative writers, technical writers, software developers, students and everyone in between. By writing text in Shortnote, one may significantly reduce the time they spend writing or typing. It is especially useful for those that type, as a Shortnote file can easily be compiled into typical English text.

## Tokenization

Each shortened word is referred to as a *token*. Tokens are compiled to English when converting a .short file to English text. To prevent translation of a token, prepend it with a *bang*, or exclaimation mark (!). For example, whereas "c" would translate to "can", "!c" will translate to "c".

## Dictionary

## English Compiler

The Shortnote English compiler is currently in development.

## Future Work

* Shortnote can be expanded to automatically detect tense in context to allow the same token to be used for multiple tenses.
